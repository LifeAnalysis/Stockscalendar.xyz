# Hermes Robinhood Chain

Next.js command center for Robinhood Chain stock tokens, Kalshi market context, public event links, and Nuvolari quote preparation.

The app does not sign transactions. It prepares atomic stock buy/sell/rotate quotes only after exact token contracts, wallet EOA, and integer base-unit amount are present.

## Source Of Truth

Robinhood stock tokens are currently the official testnet contracts from `https://docs.robinhood.com/chain/contracts/`: `TSLA`, `AMZN`, `PLTR`, `NFLX`, and `AMD`, plus payment tokens `WETH` and `USDG`.

Kalshi market data uses the public Trade API. Calendar data uses public finance endpoints where available and always returns fallback public links for manual inspection.

## Data Pipeline

`/api/robinhood/intel` is the aggregate source for Hermes. It returns explicit pipeline checks for Robinhood Chain token contracts, Kalshi public markets, and public event calendars, plus a compact `agent_context` object consumed by `/api/chat`.

`/api/chat` passes that context to OpenRouter when `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is configured. Without OpenRouter, it still returns a deterministic pipeline-aware response and includes the raw intel payload for inspection.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
