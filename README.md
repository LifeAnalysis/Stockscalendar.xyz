# Hermes Robinhood Chain

Next.js command center for Robinhood Chain stock tokens, Kalshi market context, public event links, and Nuvolari quote preparation.

The app does not sign transactions. It prepares atomic stock buy/sell/rotate quotes only after exact token contracts, wallet EOA, and integer base-unit amount are present.

## Source Of Truth

Robinhood stock tokens are currently the official testnet contracts from `https://docs.robinhood.com/chain/contracts/`: `TSLA`, `AMZN`, `PLTR`, `NFLX`, and `AMD`, plus payment tokens `WETH` and `USDG`.

Kalshi market data uses the public Trade API series and market feeds, then filters locally against Robinhood stock symbols and company keywords such as Tesla, Amazon, Palantir, Netflix, and Advanced Micro Devices. Hermes does not treat `kalshi.com/search` pages as machine-readable source data, because the website search can surface noisy or protected results that are not a clean execution signal.

Stock context comes from free/no-secret feeds: Stooq public quote CSVs, Yahoo Chart historical OHLC data, SEC EDGAR submissions, and GDELT news search. Calendar data uses public finance endpoints where available and returns public links for manual inspection.

## Data Pipeline

`/api/robinhood/intel` is the aggregate source for Hermes. It returns explicit pipeline checks for Robinhood Chain token contracts, stock signal feeds, Blockscout explorer discovery, Kalshi public markets, and public event calendars, plus per-stock Hermes recommendations and a compact `agent_context` object consumed by `/api/chat`.

`/api/chat` passes that context to OpenRouter when `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is configured. Without OpenRouter, it still returns a deterministic pipeline-aware response and includes the raw intel payload for inspection.

`/api/hermes/output` returns compact browser-safe data by default. Add `?debug=1` only when the full backend payload is needed for inspection.

The frontend loads in stages: supported stock catalog first, compact stock intel second, and the slower Hermes/OpenRouter response last. While Hermes is running, the UI stays interactive and shows progress instead of blocking the stock desk.

`/api/hermes/backtest?symbol=TSLA` builds the previous-three-earnings table for supported Robinhood Chain stock tokens. It uses curated 2020+ earnings dates, Yahoo Chart OHLC around each earnings date, date-bounded GDELT headlines, Kalshi public market matches when available, and OpenRouter for the concise event read. When `DATABASE_URL` or `POSTGRES_URL` is configured, results are cached in Postgres in `hermes_earnings_backtests`; otherwise the route falls back to in-memory cache for local development.

## Deployment

This repository is configured for Vercel as a Next.js app via `vercel.json`. The active backend is the set of Next API routes under `app/api/*`; external services are OpenRouter, Nuvolari staging, Kalshi public Trade API, Yahoo Finance, Stooq, SEC EDGAR, GDELT, and the Robinhood Chain testnet RPC/explorer.

Use a production Reown project ID with the deployed domain allowlisted. If `NEXT_PUBLIC_REOWN_PROJECT_ID` is empty, wallet connect controls intentionally stay disabled.

## Development

`npm run dev` validates local runtime env, clears stale `.next` output, builds, and starts the app exactly like production. Use `.env.local` for real local values; Vercel encrypted or sensitive env vars can pull as empty strings, so do not assume `vercel env pull` produced a usable local file.

```bash
npm install
npm run env:check
npm run lint
npm run dev
npm run build
```

For hot reload, use `npm run dev:watch`. For UI-only work without external integrations, use `npm run dev:loose`.
