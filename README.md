# Hermes Robinhood Chain

Hermes Robinhood Chain is a Next.js research command center for Robinhood Chain testnet stock tokens. It combines official testnet token contracts with public market context, Kalshi prediction-market data, SEC filings, GDELT news, earnings calendars, historical chart data, and an OpenRouter-powered Hermes summary layer.

The product is intentionally research-first. It can prepare unsigned RH Swap transaction requests for wallet execution when a Robinhood Chain stock-token pair exists, but it never signs or submits trades server-side.

## What It Does

- Shows the supported Robinhood Chain stock universe: `TSLA`, `AMZN`, `PLTR`, `NFLX`, and `AMD`.
- Keeps the classic DEX-style buy/sell ticket visible while separating quote readiness, pair availability, and wallet execution.
- Loads Hermes intelligence progressively so the UI is usable before slower model output finishes.
- Explains why Hermes does or does not support a stock route.
- Breaks down confidence into the same evidence categories used by the backend scoring model.
- Displays earnings context, recent earnings backtests, public news, SEC filing links, latest quote snapshots, and Kalshi YES/NO market pricing.
- Shows data-source health and provenance for every major upstream feed.
- Records a local post-trade/quote journal when quote events or transaction hashes exist.
- Uses optimized motion-icon assets under `public/media/icons` with originals preserved under `assets/originals`.

## Current Product Surface

The main app is a two-column stock desk:

- **Left side:** buy/sell ticket, supported stock strip, earnings calendar, and stock selection.
- **Right side:** selected-stock research panel with chart ranges, Hermes output, confidence breakdown, reasoning graph, earnings backtest, prediction-market overlay, data provenance, and local journal.

### Hermes Panels

- **Hermes output:** OpenRouter final vote plus user-facing textual output, with deterministic fallback only when the model is unavailable.
- **Why this route?:** selected source/target token route, wallet/network/quote state, and key evidence chips.
- **Confidence decomposition:** point-by-point confidence contribution from Kalshi market quality, earnings, quote data, SEC, news, and market breadth, with route/explorer shown separately as readiness checks.
- **Reasoning graph:** visual evidence graph linking route, public sources, market context, and Hermes decision.
- **Earnings backtest:** previous earnings events with post-event move, news count, Kalshi context, and concise analysis.
- **Prediction-market overlay:** matched Kalshi markets, YES/NO bid/ask, liquidity, close time, and match quality.
- **Data provenance:** source status table for Robinhood contracts, Kalshi, calendars, Stooq/Yahoo, SEC, GDELT, and explorer discovery.
- **Post-trade journal:** local `localStorage` journal of quote-ready/rejected or transaction-confirmed events.

## Execution Boundary

Robinhood Chain stock-token quote preparation uses RH Swap testnet contracts:

- `/api/robinhood/trade` validates exact token addresses and prepares wallet-signable transaction data only.
- The integrated DEX is RH Swap's testnet `MockSwapFactory` at `0xE9a696F428725134AB06454A0CB2E7434e3deC4c`.
- RH Swap is a direct native-ETH pair DEX. There is no app-side router and the server does not sign transactions.
- If an official stock token has no RH Swap pair or no liquidity, the endpoint returns an explicit `no_pair` or `no_liquidity` response.
- Nuvolari integration is not used because Nuvolari does not support Robinhood Chain stock tokens.

## Data Sources

Hermes uses only machine-readable data sources that the backend can inspect directly:

- **Robinhood Chain docs/contracts:** official token universe and payment tokens.
- **Robinhood Chain explorer:** token discovery and contract confirmation context.
- **Kalshi public Trade API:** open public market and series data, locally filtered against stock symbols and company names.
- **Stooq:** public latest quote snapshots.
- **Yahoo Chart:** historical OHLC chart ranges and earnings backtest price windows.
- **MarketBeat/public calendar links:** earnings date and estimate context where available.
- **SEC EDGAR submissions:** recent material filings and filing document links.
- **GDELT/Yahoo Finance RSS:** recent stock-related article counts and top titles.
- **OpenRouter:** optional natural-language Hermes summaries and earnings-event analysis.

Hermes does not use Kalshi website search pages as source data because those pages can be noisy, protected, or unrelated to stock-specific markets.

### Database URL

`DATABASE_URL` is a Postgres connection string used only for the Hermes earnings backtest cache. If it is not set, the app falls back to in-memory caching for local development.

Valid providers include Railway Postgres, Vercel Postgres, Neon, and Supabase. The app also accepts `POSTGRES_URL` as a fallback in `lib/postgres.ts`.

## Media Assets

Motion-icon originals live in:

```text
assets/originals/
```

Optimized app assets live in:

```text
public/media/icons/
```

The optimized versions are generated at roughly 160px, 24fps, no audio, with WebM VP9 plus MP4 H.264 fallback. Regenerate them with:

```bash
scripts/compress-motion-icons.sh
```

Optional overrides:

```bash
MAX_SIZE=96 FPS=18 MP4_CRF=22 WEBM_CRF=32 scripts/compress-motion-icons.sh
```

The full background video is intentionally left at `public/media/app-background.mp4`.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run env:check
npm run dev:watch
```

Useful commands:

```bash
npm run build      # production build
npm run lint       # lint
npm run check      # lint + build
npm run dev        # production-like local boot: env check, build, start
npm run dev:loose  # UI-only dev without env validation
```

`npm run dev` validates local runtime env, clears stale `.next` output, builds, and starts the app like production. Use `.env.local` for real local values.

## Deployment

The repository is configured as a Next.js app. Production needs:

- domain-allowlisted Reown project ID
- browser-safe Robinhood Chain RPC URL
- server-side Robinhood Chain RPC URL
- real SEC user-agent contact
- optional OpenRouter key
- optional Postgres `DATABASE_URL` for persistent backtest cache

Quote execution must stay wallet-owned. The backend may prepare calldata for verified RH Swap pairs, but signing and broadcasting must remain in the connected wallet.

## Notes

- These Robinhood Chain stock tokens are testnet assets and have no real economic value.
- Hermes recommendations are research/explainability outputs, not financial advice.
- Kalshi data is used as supporting public prediction-market context, not as an execution venue.
- The UI should surface degraded source warnings rather than hiding missing data.
